Q1 M_1 is encrypted using the key E_K.

E_K is made using PR(A)(PU(B)).

The message M_1 is then encrypted such that it equals E_K(M_1).

Q2 M_3 is decrypted using the key D_K.

D_K is made using PR(B)(PU(A)).

The message M_3 is then encrypted such that it equals D_K(M_3).

Q3 In order to avoid someone altering the message in an undetectable manner Alice can encrypt the message 
to bob using the formula E = M_2^e MOD N using her private key and bob's public key to obtain the values.

Q4 Bob can then decipher the message using similar approch to decipher using his private key and Alice's public key.
If the message is from Alice it can be easily deciphered into coherent text otherwise it is not from her.
